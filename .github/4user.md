# Reality Check (for the user of Agent)

Writing strict rules is cheap.
Following them is not.

If you:

* ignore uncomfortable outputs
* selectively apply this standard
* treat this as “motivation” instead of enforcement

then this file is decorative and useless.

The value comes only if:

* bad ideas are actually killed
* scope is actually reduced
* decisions are actually finalized

No execution → zero return.
